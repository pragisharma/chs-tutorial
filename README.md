# chs-tutorial
The tutorial status of all teachers in CHS.

This is an organizer for the availability in different rooms during tutorials on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for Cupertino High School. It has an organized table that includes data about the teachers, their room #s, and the status of their room. The status can consist of open, closed, only open for students, or advisory. The status is editable by the respective teachers in their rooms. During advisory days, the blurb will be updated describing the specific date and timings along with a brief description. We used Flask for the backend and linked python with HTML files for the front end.

# improvements 

In order to make this app better, we would like to add all the teachers at CHS to our database and make this website available for everyone, rather than just running it locally. We’ll also add a password so that only teachers can edit the availabilities. Along with this, we’ll make the website look better using more CSS. We also probably want to link it to sheets, so teachers can just change it on that instead of on the website.
